				<h1>About Me</h1>
				<p>I am currently a senior in high school, deeply passionate about web development and technology. My journey in coding began with a curiosity for how things work behind the scenes, and it has grown into a drive to create, innovate, and solve real-world problems. Inspired by the discipline, structure, and strategic mindset of the army, I approach coding with a similar dedication—always striving for efficiency, precision, and resilience in the face of challenges.</p>
				<p>Originally from Guyana—the only English-speaking country in South America—I bring a unique cultural perspective to my work. My background has taught me the value of adaptability and perseverance, qualities that serve me well both in the classroom and in my personal projects. I enjoy exploring the intersections between technology and military strategy, finding ways to apply lessons from history and leadership to my coding practice.</p>
				<p>Outside of coding, I am an avid sports enthusiast, a dedicated gamer, and a student of military history. Whether I’m collaborating on a team project, competing in coding competitions, or learning about the great leaders and battles of the past, I am always eager to grow, connect, and make a positive impact. As I prepare for graduation and look ahead to new opportunities, I am excited to continue learning, building, and contributing to the world of technology.</p>
